From my regular dining spots pushing pricey, fruity concoctions ending in “-tini” to the moment on my last grocery store trip when I found a margarita mix display sitting next to the toilet paper, it seems evident that alcohol’s popularity has reached a new, femininity-infused peak.

Last winter the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified binge drinking among women and girls— especially high-school girls and young women, whites and Hispanics, and adult women with household incomes of $75,000 or more — as a serious but under-recognized problem.

Gabrielle Glaser’s new book, “Her Best-Kept Secret: Why Women Drink — And How They Can Regain Control,” contends that women are drinking more now than at any other time in history, at least in part to cope with the stresses of motherhood and career.
