Good evening Americans. I have a message for all of those with Hispanic origin eligible to vote in our country. In past elections, the Hispanic vote has been the least of all ethnicities being 18% lower than Caucasian voter turnout. This is harmful to the democratic process, as the representatives elected will not be as much concerned with issues that are important to you. In order to increase the Hispanic voter turnout, I will be hosting talks on current issues and the stances of politicians on various issues weekly in communities around the nation. I am hoping that this will increase the turnout, as more of the Hispanic voters will have an increased knowledge of politics. Always remember, voters come in all shapes, sizes, and ethnicities.
