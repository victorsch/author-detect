Good morning Americans. I have a message for all of the youth out there. In the past, youth votes in election have always been very low and your age group often does not vote. This is harmful to the democratic process as you will have no influence in politics and it makes it easier for immoral politicians to take advantage of you. I am asking for you to keep up exactly what you're doing. Without the youth vote to take a stance against me, my rise to a totalitarian regime as chancellor of the United States will come much easier. You are helping me in my plans to take over the United States, and as long as you don't vote I will win. So keep it up youth and always remember, if you're a youth stay away from the booth
